# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hey there! I'm Karansinh Inamdar, a novice web developer 🌱 currently working on a frontend project using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I'm passionate about front-end development and love creating user-friendly interfaces that are both visually appealing and functional.

💻 I'm always looking to collaborate on front-end projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together. I'm also looking for help with back-end development and database management, so if you have expertise in those areas, I'd love to chat.

📚 Currently, I'm focused on improving my skills in JavaScript and Node.js, and I'm always on the lookout for new learning opportunities. In my free time, I enjoy 🏃‍♂️ running, 🎮 gaming, and 📷 photography.

Take a look at my repositories to see some of my past work, and feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or ideas for collaboration!<br><br>
