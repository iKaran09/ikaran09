# üí´ About Me:
Hey there! I'm Karansinh Inamdar, a novice web developer currently working on a frontend project using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I'm passionate about front-end development and love creating user-friendly interfaces that are both visually appealing and functional.

I'm always looking to collaborate on front-end projects, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together. I'm also looking for help with back-end development and database management, so if you have expertise in those areas, I'd love to chat.

Currently, I'm focused on improving my skills in JavaScript and Node.js, and I'm always on the lookout for new learning opportunities.<br><br>
